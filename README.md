My first game with 2-D graphics, created in AP Computer Science A. 

Playable in both single-player and two-player modes.

# controls

Single-player:
Left arrow - Left

Right arrow - Right


Second-player (if applicable):

Modified for ENGR 1620 to control player movement with brain waves from Mindwave electroencephalogram.
